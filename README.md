# Emotion-Classification-of-Children-s-Expressions
A Deep Learning-Based Approach for Detecting 'Happy' and 'Sad' Emotions in Children

## Description  
This project presents a deep learning-based model designed to classify children's facial expressions into two emotions: **Happy** and **Sad**. Unlike traditional emotion recognition models trained predominantly on adult facial datasets, this approach incorporates advanced **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks**, **Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAMs)**, and **robust data augmentation** to enhance classification accuracy for children's expressions.

The model was trained using a dataset expanded via **Stable Diffusion image synthesis**, ensuring a diverse and realistic set of training samples. It incorporates **Batch Normalization, Dropout, and SE Attention mechanisms**, leading to an impressive accuracy of **89%**.
